**How to Contribute**

    * If you don't find a suitable issue, feel free to discuss new ideas by creating an issue in Jira.
* **Claim the Issue (Optional):**
    * Move issue to WIP status to let us know you're working on it. This helps avoid duplicate work.
* **Work on the Issue:**
    * Use the Confluence page linked in the issue for detailed specifications and discussions.
    * Create branch. You can do it using link within Jira ticket.
    * Feel free to ask questions in the comments section of the Jira issue or reach out to us directly.
* **Create a Pull Request:**
    * Once you've completed your work, create a pull request (PR) on GitHub. You can do it using link within the Jira ticket.
    * Include a clear and concise description of your changes in the PR description. We have a template for PR.
    * Reference the related Jira issue in your PR description for easy tracking. Just start all commits from Jira ticket number. Like `git commit -m "DT-100 Add new button"`

    * We will review your PR and provide feedback. 
    * Address any comments and iterate on your code as needed. 

**Pull Request Guidelines**

* **Code Style:**
    * Follow the existing code style and formatting conventions in the project.
    * We used linter or code formatter like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure consistency.
* **Testing:**
    * Write unit tests for your changes, if applicable. 
    * Existing tests should continue to pass after your modifications. We use Husky pre-push to run unit tests.
* **Documentation:**
    * Update any relevant documentation in Confluence if your changes affect functionality or usage.
* **Clean Commits:**
    * Use clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you made or Comments in PR template.
